            "Born in Cape Town in an area called Langa, the first black township in Cape Town. As a boy who matriculated in 2023, I have embraced technology as an integral part of my life and education. I am passionate about exploring the latest advancements in tech, whether it's coding, robotics, or virtual reality. My curiosity drives me to constantly seek out new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the digital realm. Outside of the digital world, I also have a strong commitment to physical fitness. You'll often find me at the gym, pushing myself to achieve new personal bests and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Balancing my love for technology with my dedication to fitness, I strive to embody a well-rounded approach to life, always seeking growth and improvement in all aspects of my endeavors.I am a very well organised individual, self confident and loyal person. I consider myself a responsible and orderly person."
